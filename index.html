  <h1>What Is a Button Cell Battery?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>button cell battery</strong>, also known as a <strong>coin cell battery</strong>, is a small, round, and flat single-cell battery typically used in compact electronic devices that require a low and consistent power supply. The name "button cell" comes from its button-like shape, while "coin cell" emphasizes its similarity in size and shape to coins.</p>

  <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Round, flat</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> 5 mm to 25 mm in diameter; 1 mm to 6 mm thick</li>
    <li><strong>Voltage:</strong> 1.5V to 3V depending on chemistry</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Low mAh, suited for low-drain applications</li>
    <li><strong>Polarity:</strong> Flat side is positive; rimmed side is negative</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Does a Button Cell Work?</h2>
  <p>Button cells generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction between the anode (negative) and cathode (positive), with an electrolyte in between. The chemistry determines voltage and performance. Typical components include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anode:</strong> Zinc or Lithium</li>
    <li><strong>Cathode:</strong> Silver oxide, manganese dioxide, or air cathode</li>
    <li><strong>Electrolyte:</strong> KOH (alkaline), organic solvent (lithium), salt water (zinc-air)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wristwatches</li>
    <li>Hearing aids</li>
    <li>Digital thermometers</li>
    <li>Laser pointers</li>
    <li>Calculators</li>
    <li>Car remotes</li>
    <li>Motherboards (BIOS)</li>
    <li>LED keychains and toys</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Environmental Notes</h2>
  <p>Older button cells often contained mercury, which is hazardous. Today, most are mercury-free and environmentally safer. Proper recycling is essential to prevent leakage and pollution.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Button cell batteries are essential compact power sources for many low-power electronic devices. With a wide range of chemistries, voltages, and sizes, understanding their characteristics helps in choosing the right battery for the right application.</p>
